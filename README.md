## Reflection of Assessment
It appears to me that the material posted provides three different forms of assessment. 
*Formative assessment which happens on the fly, and the teacher leaves details to the implementation of the assessment. 
  To find what students know before I begin instruction, I usually pad the beginning of the discussion with questions prodding individuals to answer. 
*Self an peer asessment which is when a student is given feedback and is asked to evaluate their feedback to improve
*Summative assessment, which in my mind is a pure assessment in which a student is judged on what they have already learned.
